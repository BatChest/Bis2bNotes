## Our local land snail comes in two basic colors: brown-striped and black-striped. Color is determined by alleles at a single locus, where the black allele is dominant to the brown allele. Last week, you collected 1000 snails from your garden in Davis: 64% of these snails were brown, and 36% were black. Based on these data, you conclude that the frequency of the black allele in your garden population is
 - e.) you can't determine because you don't know if the population is in HW equilibrium

## If the frequency of the C allele is 0.2 in a population with only 2 alleles at this locus, what will the frequency of heterozygotes be if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">c) 0.32</mark> 
- Since we are given C allele is 0.2 and we know that both frequencies must equal 1 so we can do 1-0.2 = 0.8 frequency of other allele. We want the heterozygous frequency and under Hardy-Weinberg we simply do 2(0.2$\times$ 0.8) = 0.32

## A moth has three alleles at a locus that controls antenna color: X1, X2 and X3. X1 is dominant to X2 and X3; X1 produces red antennae. X2 is co-dominant to X3; X2X2 produces yellow antennae, X3X3 produces white antennae, and X2X3 produces light yellow antennae. The phenotypic frequencies in a population are as follows:
- 0.04 WHITE 
- 0.16 LIGHT YELLOW
- 0.16 YELLOW 
- 0.64 RED
## Assuming that this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the frequency of the X3 allele in this population?
### b) 0.20

## You measure the allele frequencies in the parental generation of a cheetah population, and find that f(A) is 0.6. There are only two alleles at this locus. In the next generation of cheetahs you find the following genotype frequencies: f(AA) = 0.36, f(Aa) = 0.48, f(aa) = 0.16. Which assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is likely being violated?
### e.) none of the assumptions are being violated

# 6)
## Imagine a population of frogs with 2 color morphs (forms); green (genotypes Gg and GG) and yellow (genotype gg). The population is initially in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Then, frogs begin to mate assortatively for color. After one generation of positive assortative mating, you would expect to observe a change in
### b.) number of genotypic frequencies

## You know that a population of elk has 2 alleles, E and e, at a single locus that controls the color of a rump patch. The frequency of allele E, p(E) = 0.10 in the parental generation. In the offspring of this parental generation, the genotypic frequencies are EE = 0.01, Ee = 0.18, and ee = 0.81. You suspect that
### a.) the populations are in HW equilibrium
Because if you calculate the genotype frequencies they match with the observed frequencies

## (a) Imagine a population of birds living on an island near the mainland. If 6 birds from the mainland join the island population, which assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg model will be violated?
- no gene flow
## (b) Historically, the population of California Condors probably numbered in the thousands of birds. However, because of human use of pesticides, hunting, and habitat destruction, the population declined to no more than 13 individuals. Now, thanks to captive breeding, re-introduction programs, pesticide control, and habitat preservation, the population is increasing in size. What would you predict would be the primary difference in numbers of alleles per locus and allelic frequencies in the pre-historic versus modern (recovered) populations of condors?
- The modern population would have a smaller number of alleles per locus. Overall, allelic frequencies will have changed.
## b)What process likely caused this difference?
- Because of the bottleneck, the population has lost some alleles at many loci.
## (c) Which assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is being violated in cases (a and (b) above?
- genetic drift ; this change in allele frequencies is not "directed"; it is due to chance and to sampling bias, the essence of genetic drift.
## (d) If the California Condors choose to mate on the basis of tail length, which assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium would be violated?
- random mating

## A population of a marine snail at Bodega Bay has 4 alleles at a locus that controls shell color. Each genotype expresses a unique color. What is the maximum number of phenotypes in the population?
- c.) 10
- There is an formula to obtain the number of possible genotypes, where "n" = number of alleles at a locus: Number of genotypes = 2 n(n+1)

# 11)
## A population of plants has 2 alleles, P and p, at a locus controlling petal color: f(P) = 0.60 and f(p) = 0.4. When you study the frequency of heterozygotes in the population you find that f(Pp) = 0.24. This would be expected if…

## In a natural population of 1252 wild radish plants at the UC Davis airport, you notice that there are two flower colors, red and white. You breed the plants in the lab, and show that flower color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The red allele is dominant to the white allele. You go back out to the airport and notice that both honeybees and bumblebees pollinate the radish flowers. The bumblebees primarily visit white-flowered plants, but sometimes visit red-flowered plants also. The honeybees primarily visit red-flowered plants, but sometimes visit white-flowered plants. You are asked to estimate the genotypic and allelic frequencies at the flower color locus in the Airport population. You need to do this accurately and efficiently, you should…
 - e.) none of the above. we don't know it's in HW equilibrium
 - If it was in hardy Weinberg we would be able to count the frequencies of the genotypes and then the alleles
 - But we don't know if its in Hardy Weinberg so we dont know the fraction of the R allele or r allele 
 - All we are given are phenotype data we cant calculate the frequencies

## Give a simple genetic definition of evolution. How does this differ from a purely phenotypic definition of evolution?
- A change over time in the proportions of individual organisms differing genetically in one or more traits. This definition describes the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">change in genes for a certain trait</mark>. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Change in heritable properties</mark>

# 15
## From an evolutionary perspective, which of the following is the most appropriate level for measuring genetic variation: (1) the cell; (2) the individual; (3) the population; (4) the community; (5) the ecosystem? Why did you choose the answer that you did?
- 3. The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">population</mark> because the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">individual cannot evolve on its own</mark> 
- their <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">genetic composition cannot change</mark>

# 16
## At which level of biological organization is it most appropriate to use the term "adaptation": individuals, populations, species, communities? Why did you choose your answer? Does it matter whether you define adaptation as a process or a state of being?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">individuals</mark> because they are the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ones that adapt to their environments</mark>

# 17
## Which of the following statements is NOT true about allele frequencies?
### d.) if two populations have that same alleles, they will have the same allelic frequencies

# 18
## Which of the following processes is LEAST likely to change ALLELIC frequencies? Why or why not?
- Inbreeding
	- leads to an increase in homozygosity and a reduction in genetic diversity within a population
	- result in the expression of deleterious recessive traits and a decrease in overall fitness

# 19
## Natural selection that preserves mean phenotypic values for a trait is called…
### d.) stabilizing selection

# 20
## In terms of genetic control, what is the basic difference between traits that exhibit continuous variation versus discrete variation?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Quantitative traits</mark> = <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">continuously varied traits that are controlled by multiple genes</mark> (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">polygenic</mark>). Each of these genes acts like a normal mendelian locus, but when their effects on phenotype are added up, the result is continuous phenotypic variation for a trait. Examples: height in humans, skin pigmentation, wheat chaff color.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Mendelian traits</mark> = <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">traits exhibiting discrete states</mark> (long vs. tall, wrinkled vs. smooth) and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">qualitative</mark>. Mutations of major effect were key in the evolutionary process, especially the evolution of new species

# 21
## In nature, there is never truly random mating, populations are finite, individuals carry genes from population to population, mutations occur, and natural selection acts. Why, then, does it make any sense for evolutionary biologists to use the H-W model, which is based on a set of assumptions that are generally false?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">to compare to a perfect scenario to observe change</mark>

# 22
## As far as we know, natural selection cannot adapt organisms to future changes in the selective regime. Yet, many organisms exhibit responses in advance of natural events. For example, geese migrate south from the summer breeding grounds long before the weather changes. How can these "anticipatory" behaviors have evolved?
- Genotype to migrate gets passed down through generations and so the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">geese that migrate will survive</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">have a better likelihood of producing offspring</mark>

# 23
## What do you expect will happen to means and variances of phenotypes in a population subject to the following kinds of selection? Be sure to be able to show diagrammatically how the distribution of normally distributed trait will change after being subjected to each of these kinds of selection. Make sure you understand the relationship between a fitness and response function for stabilizing selection, directional selection, and disruptive selection. Give examples of each.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Stabilizing selection</mark> : preserves average phenotype. Favors individuals with the mean value of a trait, which reduces phenotypic variance for that trait. (ex. human birth weight)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Directional Selection</mark>: favors individuals that are either above or below the average phenotype. Shifts the mean value of a trait up or down, which usually reduces phenotypic variances for that trait, acts over many generations and can lead to major evolutionary changes (ex peppered moths.)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Disruptive/ diversifying</mark>: favors individuals that are both above and below the average making them more successful than the average. Favors individuals at the extremes of a phenotypic distribution. It has little effect on the mean value of a trait, increases phenotypic variance for that trait. It maintains genetic variation in a population and it is a form of balancing selection
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">heterosis</mark>: the mean of phenotypes is expected to increase due to the advantageous combination of alleles from different parental lines. Variance in phenotypes may also decrease as the population becomes more genetically similar.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">frequency-dependent selection</mark>: the mean and variance of phenotypes can fluctuate depending on the relative frequency of different phenotypes in the population
	- Rare phenotypes may experience positive selection, causing an increase in their mean and potentially an increase in variance
	- common phenotypes may experience negative selection, leading to a decrease in their mean

# 24
## Which of the following is most likely to occur in populations that are reduced to a very small number of breeding individuals? Choose one answer from each pair:
## a) Variation in genotypes and phenotypes is likely to increase, relative to the amount of variation in the original population, OR b) Variation in genotypes and phenotypes is likely to decrease, relative to the amount of variation in the original population.
- b.) variation in pheno and geno will decrease
## a) Genotypes and phenotypes are likely to occur at the same frequencies as they did in the original populations, OR b) Genotypes and phenotypes are likely to occur at different frequencies than in the original population.
- b.) pheno and geno will occur at different frequencies as previous populations
## a) The probability of extinction would probably be similar for the reduced population than for a similar population with large numbers of breeding individuals, OR b) The probability of extinction over a specified period of time (say 104 years) would probably be higher for the reduced population compared to a population with many breeding individuals
- b.) probability of extinction would be higher

# 25
## Many textbooks imply that the reason Irish elk, in which males had enormous antlers (spanning nearly 3 m), became extinct is that the males simply could no longer haul around such large ornaments without collapsing. What is the flaw in this argument?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">natural selection would have favored elk with smaller antlers, leading to an increase in the genotypic frequency of small antlers</mark>

# 26
## What is the basic difference between intersexual and intrasexual selection? Give examples of each mode. Can you imagine an example in which both modes of sexual selection operate?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intrasexual selection</mark> affects the outcome of competition within a sex over mates (courtship rituals of lobsters).
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intersexual selection</mark> affects the attractiveness of an individual to the opposite sex as a potential mate (peacocks)

# 27
## In a landmark study, Malte Andersson experimentally manipulated the lengths of the tails of male widowbirds, and compared their nesting success before and after the manipulation. Which of the following graphs provides the strongest support for the hypothesis that selection favors the evolution of longer tails in male widowbirds?
![[Pasted image 20230513134644.png]]
- Only graph D

# 28 
## The ability to recognize kin may promote the evolution of altruistic traits. What is an altruistic trait? What is the evolutionary rationale for this argument?
- If altruism in effect reduces an organism's fitness, then it would seem logical for natural selection to select against altruistic traits and eventually reduce their frequency to zero. 
- Hamilton's rule states that if rb - c > 0, and individual should willingly partake in altruistic behavior. 
- This makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, because the higher the "r," or relatedness between individuals, the better the payoff the altruistic individual will receive in terms of passing on its genes to the next generation. 
- If sister hymenoptera have an r of 0.75, it would make more sense for them to help their mother rear more sisters than it would for them to rear their own daughters, since then r would be 0.50

# 29
## Explain the rationale for the evolution of sterile female workers in social Hymenoptera. Can you use the same reasoning to explain why young acorn woodpeckers often help their parents rear offspring, rather than reproduce themselves? Can you use the same reasoning to explain the human demographic transition?
- This is because, if we assume kin selection to be an altruistic mechanism (even though it may not be ), then it is difficult to view human reproduction in terms of the theory of kin selection, since humans appear to reproduce indiscriminately with respect to kinship. 
- Sterile female workers, help protect the queen to help make more offspring. 
- They are 75% related to their full sisters while only 50% percent related to offspring. 
- With the acorn woodpeckers, the general idea of kin selection can be applied, although the exact genetics differ. 
- Acorn woodpeckers do indirectly benefit genetically from helping their parents to rear more offspring, but the patterns of relatedness between siblings differ from those of Hymenoptera

# 30
## Using Hamilton’s Rule (rB>C = rB-C>0)), explain the evolutionary reasoning underlying J. B. S. Haldane‘s famous quote, "I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins."

# 31
## All else being equal, according to kin selection theory, which of the following represents the order in which you should be willing to help another individual with respect to its degree of relatedness to you?
- your identical twin, your full-sibling, your parents, your grandparents, your 2nd cousin

# 32 
## Which of the following represents a major obstacle to the evolution of altruism?
### e) All of above so  
- a) Close association of kin. 
- b) The presence of genetically based traits that cause selfish behavior. 
- c) The ability to help relatives produce more offspring than they could on their own. 
- d) The existence of sterile castes of workers in social insects
Are all major obstacles
