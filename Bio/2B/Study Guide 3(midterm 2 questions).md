## Why was the problem of the age of the Earth central to Darwin’s theory? How old is the Earth? How old did Darwin think it was?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">earth is 4.5 billion years old</mark> but Lord Kelvin, during <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Darwin</mark>'s time, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">believed it to be 100,000,000 yrs old</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Darwin was confused to whether there was even enough time</mark> for evolution to occur
- Darwin was <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">confused because he saw evolution as a process that occurred over a large period of time</mark> but, he looked at Lord Kelvin's calculations and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">thought the earth was not old enough for these calculations to be possibl</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">e</mark>

## Which of the following is/are among the necessary conditions for evolution by natural selection?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">There is phenotypic variation in natural populations</mark>.



# (6)
## A key element in the development of Darwin’s theory was…
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">artificial selection could lead to the formation of new varieties.</mark>
- where humans selectively breed individuals with desired traits, can result in the formation of new varieties or breeds.
- selection pressures acting over time could drive significant changes in populations
- similar processes could occur in nature through natural selection, leading to the evolution of species

## Summarize the major contributions of the following scientists to evolutionary biology.

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Charles Lyell</mark>: 
- His concept of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">uniformitarianism</mark>, which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">suggested that geological processes occurring in the present can explain past geological events</mark>, greatly <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">influenced Charles Darwin's</mark> understanding of gradual change over long periods of time, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">supporting the idea of evolution</mark>.
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Jean Baptiste Lamarck</mark>:
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">proposed an early theory of evolution</mark> known as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Lamarckism</mark> or the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">inheritance of acquired characteristics</mark>.
- He believed that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">traits acquired by individuals during their lifetime could be passed on to their offspring</mark>, driving evolutionary change.
- Although his specific mechanism of inheritance <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">was later disproven</mark>, Lamarck's <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ideas contributed to the development of the concept of species change over time</mark>.
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Alfred Russel Wallace</mark>:
- Wallace <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">independently</mark> arrived at the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">theory of natural selection</mark>, similar to Darwin, and co-authored a joint presentation with him on the subject
- provided valuable evidence for the process of natural selection and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">played a significant role in the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection</mark>.
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Charles Darwin</mark>:
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">outlined the theory of evolution by natural selection</mark>
- He proposed that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">species evolve over time through the process of natural selection</mark>, where <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">individuals with advantageous traits have a better chance of survival and reproduction</mark>
- Darwin's work revolutionized the understanding of biodiversity, provided a scientific framework for explaining the diversity of life on Earth, and is considered one of the most important contributions to evolutionary biology
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Thomas Malthus</mark>:
- Malthus's work on population dynamics, as presented in his essay "An Essay on the Principle of Population," <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">had a profound influence on Darwin's thinking</mark>
- Malthus's observation that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">populations have the potential to increase faster than the availability of resources</mark> helped <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Darwin realize the concept of struggle for existence</mark> and the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">role of competition in natural selection</mark>
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Gregor Mendel</mark>:
- conducted groundbreaking <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">experiments on pea plants and established the fundamental principles of inheritance</mark>
- provided empirical evidence for the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">transmission of discrete hereditary units (genes) from parents to offspring</mark>, laying the foundation for the field of genetics and contributing to our <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">understanding of how traits are inherited and can evolve over generations</mark>

## True/False: By the time Darwin returned from the Voyage of the Beagle, he had developed the theory of evolution by natural selection
- False

# (11)
## What is the difference between artificial and natural selection? Give an example of each. Why was Darwin’s analysis of artificial selection so critical to his development of the theory of natural selection?

 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Artificial selection</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Breeding organisms with specific traits in order to produce offspring with identical traits.</mark> 
	 - Example:<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> An example is the selective breeding of dogs for specific traits like size, coat color, or temperament</mark>
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Natural selection</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.</mark>
	 - An example is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria</mark>.
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Artificial selection</mark> helped <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">show that certain genotypes and such could be altered in order to get desirable traits</mark>. 
 - Artificial selection is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">process by which humans select certain naturally occurring variations to use in breeding new plants and animals</mark>. 
 - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Darwin thought that a similar process in nature could explain how organisms change over time</mark>.

# (12)
## What is a vestigial organ? How could vestigial organs and “bad” design constitute evidence that evolution has occurred?
- A vestigial organ is a structure in an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">organism that has diminished in size or function</mark> compared to its ancestral form, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">often no longer serving a significant purpose</mark>
- Vestigial organs are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">remnants of evolutionary history</mark> and can <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">provide evidence for evolution</mark> as they suggest that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">organisms have evolved from ancestors with different structures or functions</mark>
- The presence of vestigial organs and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"bad" design</mark> in organisms <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">supports the idea that they have undergone evolutionary changes over time</mark> rather than being intentionally designed, as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">they do not reflect optimal or efficient design</mark> but rather the remnants of ancestral traits that are no longer advantageous in their current environment

# (13)
## In terms of ongoing evolutionary change, what is the problem with blending inheritance?
- Blending inheritance <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">stated that once genes had been "mixed"</mark> through two parents, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">they were ultimately inseparable</mark>. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">But, when they bred a red and white snapdragon to get a pink snapdragon</mark>, they <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">found out mating that snapdragon again could lead to getting white and red again</mark>)

# (14)
## What evidence would you use to reject Larmarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lamarkian Inheritance</mark> says an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">organism can pass on to its offspring physical characteristics that the parent organism acquired</mark> through use or <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">disuse during its lifetime</mark>. But, weisman's test proved that wrong. 
- He used over <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">20 generations of mice</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cutting their tail each generation to see if that changed the phenotype in the other generations</mark> (hence the tail got shorter) but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">that did not work</mark>.

# (15)
## Darwin knew nothing about Mendelian inheritance, yet he understood that many traits were heritable. How would you define “heritable”, and what evidence did Darwin (and many others) use to establish that many traits were heritable?
- "Heritable" refers to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">traits or characteristics that can be passed down</mark> from parents to offspring <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">through genetic information</mark>
- Darwin <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">knew heritability existed because he could see that offspring looked very similar to their parents</mark>. 
- They were able to take in the same traits. 
- As he had gone on his voyage, he had been able to see that some <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">animals share a common ancestor but variation had caused them to differentiate in the way they look</mark>.
## a) In the two examples of natural selection that we discussed in lecture (bill size in finches; human skin color), what is the evidence that the traits in question are heritable (and therefore can evolve)?
- When finches faced the drought in the 70s, many of the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">smaller beak finches had passed, preventing them to not survive/reproduce</mark>. 
- That <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">allowed the larger beaked finches to reproduce more, causing a 4% increase in bill size in the population</mark>. 
- That <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">showed bill size was heritable</mark>. 
- Seeing skin color, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">initially our ancestors were light skinned</mark>, but as they <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">moved to warmer climates, they adapted to live in the sun</mark> (more melanin) and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">their offspring had the same melanin as well</mark>.

# (16)
## What were the alternative ways that Darwin and his contemporaries attempted to explain inheritance and how did they fail as explanations?
1) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lamarckian inheritance</mark> of acquired characteristics - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Acquired characteristics are not able to be inherited</mark>
2) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Blending Inheritance</mark> - Even though <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">characteristics can be blended</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">they can be altered when the offspring are being born</mark>
3) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Pangenesis</mark> (Darwin, 1868) - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Supposed Gemmules live in every person and can be altered by the environment</mark> (wrong, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">tail cutting did not affect gemules</mark> Cutting rats tail did not affect change their tail sizes in future generations)

# (17)
## The major difference(s) between Lamarck's view of evolution and that of Darwin was/were that ..
- Lamarck considered the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">generation of heritable variation to be directed by the environment</mark>.


# (20)
## How did Lyell’s views about the formation of major geological structures in the history of the Earth differ from those of Cuvier? 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cuvier</mark> - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Natural disasters changes</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">catastrophism</mark>, proposing that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">major geological structures were formed through sudden and catastrophic events</mark> followed by new creations
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lyell</mark> - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">overtime geography changes</mark>
	- advocated for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">uniformitarianism</mark>, suggesting that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">geological processes occurring at a gradual and uniform pace over long periods of time</mark> shaped the Earth's features
## How were Lyell’s ideas about the forces that drive geological change important to Darwin in his development of evolutionary theory?
- Lyell's ideas about the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> slow and continuous processes shaping the Earth's</mark> surface influenced Darwin, providing him with a framework to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">understand gradual changes over time and the idea that small, incremental changes could accumulate to produce significant transformations</mark>, which was critical to his development of the theory of evolution by natural selection



# (22)
## Which of the following is the best description of how saguaro cacti evolved to have long roots?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Saguaros with short roots produced fewer seeds each year than saguaros with longer roots</mark>

# (23)
## During the time period when saguaro cacti were evolving to their current form, there were years with very little rain. What likely happened to the saguaro cacti during the driest years?
- a) - d) are all true.
- Some of the saguaro cacti managed to obtain the water they needed.
- Saguaro cacti with the shortest roots were more likely to die.
- Some of the saguaro cacti survived with less water than normal.
- Some of the saguaro cacti grew longer roots.

# (24)
## Every individual plant and animal is affected by the environment during its lifetime. For example, a tree will grow slanted if it lives on a windy ridge. What role did the responses of individuals to their hot and dry environment play in the evolution of waxy “skin” among saguaro cacti?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">b) Individuals with mutations for waxier skin left more surviving offspring than those with genes for less waxy skin</mark>.

# (25)
## A large population of saguaro cacti thrives in a wide valley in Southern Arizona. The valley floor is flat and there are no gullies, rock outcrops, or variation in the soil. Which of the following statements best describes similarities and differences among full-grown saguaro cacti living in the valley?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">T</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">he saguaro cacti in different places share many important traits, but also have differences that may affect how long they live or how well they reproduce.</mark>

# (26)
## The ancestors of modern saguaro cacti did not have long and sharp spines. Consider the first ancestor of saguaro cacti to grow spines that were as long and sharp as the spines on saguaro cacti living in Arizona today. Why did this cactus grow such sharp spines?
- a) It was fortunate a genetic mistake gave it extra sharp spines.
- An organism cannot obtain a new trait because its beneficial it will arise by accident and then get passed on to new generations if it increases survival

# (27)
## Which of the following statements best explains patterns of variation in bill size in Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch)?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Seed size and hardness vary with rainfall, and favor birds with different bill sizes.</mark>

# (28)
## Which of the following hypotheses best explains the geographic distribution of human skin color?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A trade-off between folate metabolism and vitamin D production</mark>


# (29)
## Can you reconstruct the logic of the theory of natural selection (i.e., the necessary and sufficient conditions) and relate a biological example to that logical structure? Do you understand how to read the graphs that do (or don’t) substantiate whether the necessary and sufficient conditions are met? Are you sure???
The theory of natural selection is based on three essential components: 
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Variation</mark>
	 - within a population, there is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">variation in traits due to genetic diversity</mark>
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Heredity</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">individuals with advantageous traits have a better chance of survival and reproduction</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">passing</mark> on those <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">traits to their offspring</mark> through heredity
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Differential Reproductive Success</mark>
	- the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">frequency of advantageous traits increases in the population</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">due to</mark> the differential <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reproductive success of individuals with those traits</mark>
- A biological example of natural selection is the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
	- Initially, there is variation in bacterial populations, and some individuals may possess a genetic mutation that provides resistance to antibiotics
	- When exposed to antibiotics, these resistant individuals have a survival advantage and are more likely to reproduce, passing on the resistance trait to future generations
	- As a result, the frequency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases over time due to natural selection
