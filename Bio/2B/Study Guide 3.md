## Why is a “ladder of life/scala naturae” NOT an evolutionary concept
- It is not a an evolutionary concept because it is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">based on religion, cultural and socially pre-obtained concepts of order</mark> 
- It tells us that we are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">stuck on a ladder and there we cannot move up this ladder</mark> meaning that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">there is no Evolution</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Any deviation from the ideal type are mistakes... variation from the "ideal type" is a mistake</mark>

## Even though the possibility of evolutionary change among living organisms was acknowledged by eastern and western thinkers hundreds of years before Darwin, which of the following was missing until Darwin and Wallace?
- e) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A mechanism that could explain why organismal traits often matched the environment in which the organism lived.</mark>
- This is the case <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">because the idea of explaining how evolution occurs remained unclear until Darwin and Wallace until the proposal of natural selection</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Natural Selection</mark> is the theory that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">organisms with traits that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive</mark> and reproduce, passing their traits to their offspring.
- Explaining why organismal traits often match environment in which the organism live

## How did Hutton and Lyell’s geological theory of uniformitarianism figure in the development of the theory of natural selection? How does this differ from the theory of Cuvier’s theory of catastrophism? These are CRITICAL questions!
- Lyell's <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">theory of uniformitariansm</mark> helped develop his theory by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pointing to the notion that the processes you could observe right now; you could extrapolate or infer into the past.</mark> This principle of evolution was no to be applied to evolution, by Darwin. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Realizing that evolution was too slow to be observed directly small changes however could be accumulated </mark>
- Both <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Catastrophism and uniformitaraism</mark> deal with <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">how the problem of evolution "getting solved"</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">however catastrophism dealt with explaining how there was changes in fossil communities overtime that catastrophic events had caused mass extinctions being recognize</mark> of this <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">but it did not recognize evolutionary change</mark>...

## Define the following terms, using biological terms examples

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Genealogy</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A group of individuals or species having a common ancestry</mark>
- the various species of Darwin's finches form a closely knit genealogy

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Ontogeny  </mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">All the developmental events that occur during the existence of a living organism.</mark>
- begins with the change sin the egg at the time of fertilization and includes developmental events to the time of birth or hatching  

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Typology</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Organisms tend toward some ideal type for their species, Deviations from the ideal type of mistakes leading towards no evolution</mark>

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Homology</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Shared ancestors and inheritance, some connection to a past ancestry that can explain vestigial organs and how organisms can resemble each other</mark>
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples: the arm of a human, wing of a bird, the leg of a dog, and the flipper of a dolphin are all homologous structures but they are different and serve different purposes</mark>

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Acclimation</mark>: Change in the phenotype of an organisms that can happen within its lifetime, usually reversible. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">An organism's change in response to a change in the organism's environment</mark>
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example: acclimation in insects that can change the color</mark>


### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Analogy</mark>: Similarity of function are superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins. Different than homologous structures as they are in related organisms that were inherited from a common ancestor whereas Analogous structures that are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">similar in unrelated organisms </mark> 
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples: Wings of a fly, a moth, and bird are analogous because they developed independently as adaptations to a common function-flying</mark> 

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Phenotypic Plasticity</mark>: The ability of an organism to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">alter its phenotype in response to environmental influences without altering its genome</mark>.. (Phenotypic plasticity is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments.</mark>)
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example:</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aquatic buttercups are able to have broad leaves that grow aerially whereas submerged leaves are filamentous (thin).</mark>

## What is the major difference between a transformational theory of evolution and a variational theory? Draw a diagram that distinguishes the two. Is the Darwin/Wallace theory transformational or variational? How does a variational theory differ from a typological/essentialist (Platonic Ideal) approach
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Variational</mark>: The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">environment favors a genotype over another</mark> in which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">differential reproductive success causes changes over multiple generations</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transformational</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">transformation within generators are inherited</mark>, that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">environment directly effects the traits within a lifetime and are passed down</mark>. 
- Ex: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Like if the environment favored a big beak, small beaks would transform into a big beak over time</mark>
- They <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Both deal with the environment having some influence over the phenotype </mark>
- The Wallace/Darwin theory is a variational theory as it differs from a typological approach because a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">variationally theory accepts variation within the population and that for evolution occur there must be variation</mark> whereas a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">topological approach believes there is one ideal type and variations are simply deviations from the ideal type</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">being no variation meaning no evolution </mark>

## What might you conclude from the observation that the bones in your arm and hand are similar to the bones that make up a bat's wing?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The reason for this is that bat's wings are homologous to our arm and hand bones </mark>

## How did Cuvier explain (a) his own observations that fossils in different geological layers/strata differed from each other?
- Curvier did <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">not believe in evolution so his explanation in the layers of sediment was because the species had repopulated from somewhere else</mark>
- His <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">catastrophism, all species were all created separately(from a force from a GOD)</mark> and that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">boundaries were caused by floods, earthquakes</mark> since those catastrophic events had wiped the shaped off clean

# (21)
## How did Cuvier explain correspondence among parts of very distinct groups of organisms (mammals and birds)? How does this differ from the Darwinian explanation?
- Curvier<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> believed that there was correspondence because there was a creator</mark> who had limited set of tools and parts who used all the tools <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">to build species</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Mixing science with religion, using scientific evidence</mark> to support the idea that there was a creator. 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Differed from the Darwinian</mark> explanation <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">because he believed in a natural process(natural selection)</mark> that was <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">due to some shared ancestry but had modified over time</mark>
