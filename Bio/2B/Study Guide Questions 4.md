## What is recombination and how does it work?  
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Recombination</mark>: the process by which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">genetic material</mark> from two parental sources is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">combined to create new combinations of genes</mark> in offspring 
	 - occurs <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">during meiosis</mark>, where <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA</mark> through a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">process</mark> known as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">crossing-over</mark>
	 - is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">outcome of the crossing over</mark>. 
## Is it the same thing as crossing-over?
 - recombination refers to the overall process of genetic material exchange 
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">crossing-over</mark>: specifically <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">describes the physical exchange of DNA</mark> segments <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">between homologous chromosomes</mark>
	 - Crossing over occurs when the alleles are homo or hetero, but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">there must be heterozygous alleles on each of the homologous chromosomes </mark>at a loci for recombination to occur 
## If an organism practiced self-fertilization, could recombination occur?
 - If the organism <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">is heterozygous for a gene then yes</mark> recombination can occur if an organism practiced self-fertilization
## If an organism practiced self-fertilization, would all of its offspring be genetically identical? Why/why not?
 - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">No</mark>, because <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">if they are heterozygous for a certain gene</mark> then <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">recombination can occur and the offspring can be different</mark>

## Explain how it is possible for a cross between two plants, one with red flowers and one with white flowers, to produce all pink-flowered offspring, when a cross between two pink-flowered plants produces pink-, white- and red-flowered offspring.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Incomplete Dominance</mark>: a genetic inheritance pattern where <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">neither allele is completely dominant over the other</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">resulting in a blended phenotype</mark> that is an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intermediate between the phenotypes</mark> of the two homozygous parental individuals.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example</mark>: 
	- One flower (lets say red) is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dominant homozygous</mark> for color, while white is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">homozygous recessive</mark>. When they are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">crosses they yield heterozygotes</mark> that exhibit codominance.  
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">heterozygous offspring, if crossed, yield the original homozygous dominant and recessive phenotypes</mark>
- In order to get pink color in the first place, incomplete dominance took place, meaning that the pink plants are heterozygous. 
- Both of the pink plants from the f1 generation may seem pink, they are genetically heterozygous, meaning when breeding, they are able to go through recombination and leading F2 generation to be completely dominant for red or recessive for white

## if chickens with black feathers are crossed with chickens with white-splashed feathers, the F1 generation has gray feathers. This is an example of
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">incomplete dominance </mark>
- This is incomplete dominance because <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">none of the phenotypic characteristics from the parents are present in the offspring</mark>
- Their <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">offspring color is a mix or blend of the parents traits</mark> which is known as incomplete dominance

## If a budgerigar (a little bird) with the genotype YY (green feathers) is crossed with a budgerigar with  the genotype yy (blue feathers), the offspring all have green feathers. In what ways are these two examples (see #13) similar? How are they different?
- These examples <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">are similar because they both cover the F1 generation and show blending inheritance</mark>. 
- They <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">are different because</mark> the example with the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">budgerigar specifies if a genotype is recessive or dominant</mark>. Also, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">in one</mark>, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">bird goes through incomplete dominance while</mark>, in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the other</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the offspring show only the dominant allele</mark>

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cross the unknown breed with homozygous receive individua</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">l</mark>
### Use Punnett squares to show the expected genotypic ratios from your test cross if: 1) these birds were homozygotes. 2) these birds were heterozygotes.

# 17) In terms of Mendel’s discoveries about inheritance, how is possible for two individuals to have different genotypes and the same phenotype?
- Mendel discovered the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">law of independent assortment</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">law of segregation which stated that alleles separate into two</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">in order to become haploid (halved)</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">then the alleles separate independently and recombine randomly</mark>
- through a phenomenon called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">genetic heterogeneity</mark>
	- occurs when different combinations of alleles or genes can produce the same or similar phenotypic traits
	- individuals with different genotypes can still exhibit the same observable characteristics
- if the genotype is heterozygous and homozygous (Xx or XX) becuase the dominate allele is still in control
## How could two individuals have the same genotype, but different phenotypes?
- Organisms could have the same genotype, but different phenotypes <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">based on their environment</mark>.

## Recombination can only occur between two (or more)__ ___, _ of which is/are ____.
- loci, both; heterozygous

# 22) 
## You are interested in the inheritance of body color (the B-locus) and wing shape (the W locus) in  house flies (NOT fruit flies). At the body color locus, the B-allele (gray body) is dominant to the b-allele  (black body). At the wing shape locus, the W-allele (normal wings) is dominant to the w-allele (vestigial,  or shriveled wings). You perform the following dihybrid cross between two flies, one of which has a gray  body and normal wings (genotype: BbWw), the other of which has a black body and vestigial wings (bbww). In the F1 ’s, you observe the following genotype frequencies:
- e) the body color locus and the wing shape locus assort independently. Since the estimated ratio is 1:1:1:1 and the results are pretty similar, it is clear that independent assortment occurred.

## How do each of the following five processes keep “evolution from grinding to a halt?”
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Mutation</mark>: 
- the source of all novel genetic variation, new mutations never stop forming
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Fertilization</mark>: 
- individuals get ½ of their genes from their mother (maternal homologs) and ½ from their father (paternal homologs)
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Segregation</mark>: 
- if there are 2 different alleles on each homolog, each will be allocated at random to 1N gametes (punnet square)
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Independent Assortment</mark>:

- It is virtually impossible for all of the maternally derived or paternally derived homologs to stay together in a gamete
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Recombination</mark>: 
- Crossing over between maternal & paternal homologs produces novel combinations of alleles at different loci
