# <font color=FF0000>Why are there so many kinds/species of organisms?</font>: 
## 1) Species diverge from a common ancestor

# <font color=FF0000>Why do organisms seem to be so well-adapted and designed?</font>: 
## Charles Darwin answered this question
## Examples of design in nature
- We can look at bills of different birds as their bills have different uses as some have a sharp one's like scissors which can used for flesh
- Another one can have a straw type bill which we can assume to suck up things that they find in the ground
- Camouflage can help insects hide from predators such has the same color of leaves
## Design in Nature: The Rejection of Typology
### <font color=FF0000>Typological/Essentialist</font>
- Organisms tend toward some ideal type for their species 
- Deviations from the ideal type of mistakes
	- <font color=FF0000>Species do NOT EVOLVE</font>
### <font color=FF0000>Variational (Darwinism)</font>
- There is no "ideal" type; variation is the norm
- Evolution is possible as different variants increase or decrease in frequency 
- All the variation is the nature in life and when when we reject this ideology we can make evolution possible
- Darwin's <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">rejection of typology</mark> was the first step toward understanding the process that produces design in nature
- The second step was the growing acceptance that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">life had evolved/changed</mark> since it originated

![[Pasted image 20230420141117.png]]
- Based on religious, political, cultural, and socially pre-ordained concepts of order:
- All forms are "stuck" on a step
- There's no climbing the ladder of life: NO EVOLUTION

# Glimmers of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">EVOLUTIONARY</mark> THOUGHT LONG BEFORE DARWIN
## Al-Jahiz 
- that there was acclimation in insects that can change the color
- Notices that black lice appears on younger men with black hair while white lice appear on older men with grey hair
## Al-Biruni 
- Understood relationship of overproduction and competition 
- Didn't understand how this led to evolution; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">instead proposed there was a "creator" who cut out "all that is evil" to make room for the good" </mark>

# Social Change: The French Revolution
- Our ideas about hierarchy and traditions succumbed to new ENLIGHTMENT principles of citizenship and inalienable rights
	- Social & economic mobility are real  
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Societies are NOT immutable: How about the rest of life?</mark>

# Revealing the Fossil Record: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Evidence for extinction and evolution</mark>
## Mary Anning
- Studied limestone cliffs about 65 million years old
- Studied the fossils that live in them that represented organisms 
- Became clear that nowhere on this planet that there where any living organisms that look like the fossils that she found
- They had gone extinct

# Coming to Terms with the fossil record:
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Histories of life in a particular place recorded in fossil beds/strata</mark>
- noticed that fossil in different layers of age where different as the ones from a younger layer was different to a fossil found in an older layer
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> How did Curvier explained these changes of fossils in different rock layers?</mark>
- Revolutions/Catastrophes
- Species are mutable: NO EVOLUTION
- The catastrophes caused this and not evolution

# Curvier was right about a lot of things
## Not about scientific racism 

# Rejection of Scientific Racism
## Alexander von Humboldt


# <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Why do organism resemble each other even in their underlying features? </mark>
- Shared ancestors and inheritance(HOMOLOGY) 
- 



# Recap
- There are 10-30 million species and roughly billion species over the last 3.5 billion years
- Interactions between organisms and their physical and biotic environments shape these traits
- Trade-offs of various kinds underlie much of the diversity throughout the history of the Earth
- Population have the potential to grow exponentially but eventually the availability of resources, predators, pathogens, and competitors limits their growth

# How do these Processes(Interactions trade-offs and Population Growth) Fit together to shape the evolution of this diversity?

# Foundations: STUFF WE TAKE FOR GRANTED
- 4.5 billion years, age of the earth
- Planet has changed since it was formed
- Life has been around 3.5 billion years
- Biological world has changed since life originated 
- All life on Earth has descended from a single ancestor
- The degree of resemblance among organisms corresponds to their relatedness 
- Resemblance of relatives is due to inheritance of discrete genes 
	- <font color=FF0000>Corollary I</font>: individuals differ even close relatives 
	- <font color=FF0000>Corollary II</font>: The magnitude of the difference between relatives reflects time since they shared a common ancestor
