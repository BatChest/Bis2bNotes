# (1) Which of the following is closest to the number of likely number of species on Earth:
- There <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">are roughly around 10 million species on Earth</mark> 
- This number was found by doing estimation from known floras and faunas
- ![[Pasted image 20230422004010.png]]

# (2) Climate is described by the mean and annual variation in what two factors? How and why do these factors vary geographically? Be able describe how variation in climate is related to the types of plant life found in an area (e.g., trees vs grasses vs dessert)
- Climate is primarily described by the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">mean temperature</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">precipitation</mark> in a given area
- These factors vary geographically:
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sun is directly striking down on surface and earth's tilt lead</mark> to difference in temperature
	- Precipitation (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hadley cells and impact on regions and seasons, rainfall regions</mark>)

# (3) Which of the following patterns of annual precipitation are caused by HADLEY CELL circulation
- The Hadley Cell causes two things:
	1) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">High Rainfall at the equator</mark>
	2) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lower precipitation levels at the deserts/30N and 30S</mark>

# (4) The world’s deserts are located at
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">30N and S latitude </mark>

# (5) Explain what generates the climatic conditions that favor the development of rainforests near the equator
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">equator is being hit by the sun the most with the constant amount of rainfall that happens at the equator</mark>
- Since the equator is being hit by the sun it results in higher temperatures and those<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> higher temperatures lead to large amounts of water to evaporate to create moisture in the air</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The high amount of precipitation provides enough water for the growth of vegetation like rainforests</mark>
- Convergence further enhances rainfall and the development of rainforests in the region


# (6) The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is:
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">area of intense rainfall in the Hadley Cell Circulation</mark> where <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">northern and southern hemisphere cells meet (Converge</mark>)
- Area of the equator <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">where moist air rises fastest from the surface</mark>; after <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rising it condenses and cools creating precipitation</mark> and wet regions
- During the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">summer the ITCZ is north of the equator</mark> because the Earth is titled
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Where two Hadley cells come together</mark>, ITCZ follows Hadley cell 

# (7) Why does the vegetation on the west slope of the Sierra Mountains in northern California look very different from the vegetation at the same elevation on the east slope? Be sure to explain what drives the climate differences between the east and west slopes.
- There is a difference of perception and climate patterns.
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sierra Nevada range acts as a barrier to moisture</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">causing the Rain  Shadow Affect</mark>. 
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">west slope receives moist air from the Pacific Ocean</mark>, resulting in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higher perception and a more temperate climate</mark>. 
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">east slopes is located in the rain shadow and receives less precipitation</mark> resulting in a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">drier and more arid climate</mark> 
- These differences <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cause the vegetation on the west slope is dominated by coniferous forests redwood and pine</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Vegetation on the east slope is characterized by more arid-adapted plants such as sagebrush, juniper, and pinon pine</mark>

# (8) ![[Pasted image 20230423120019.png]]

# (9) A criticism of the morphological species concept is
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Species morphology can be influenced by the environmen</mark>t(i.e. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">snow hares changes color during different seasons</mark>)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Genetic variation within populations</mark>(i.e. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">l</mark><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">and snails are related to dogs</mark>)

# (10) If the Earth’s axis was not tilted
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">There would be no seasons</mark> because <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis</mark> which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">leads to different amounts of sunlight falling on different parts of the planet at different times of the year</mark>

![[Pasted image 20230422121803.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230422122033.png]]
# (11) The patterns of precipitation shown above could have been generated by Hadley Cells during which time of the year?
1) January
- This is the answer because during the winter the ITCZ is below the equator 
- The ITCZ increases precipitation and that causes most rainfall to occur because of the Hadley Cell
- The blue area according the legend shows the most rainfall and it is under the equator


# (12) The decrease in rainfall from the west coast of North America to the interior of the continent at 40° N latitude in North America is best explained by:
- It is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">both the rain shadow effect and westerly winds acting together</mark> as the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rain shadow effect occurs when moist air from the ocean is forced to rise over a mountain range</mark>. As air rises, it cools and moisture condenses into clouds, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">producing precipitation on the windward side of the mountains</mark>. As the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">air moves over the mountains and descends on leeward side, it warms and dries out, producing the rain shadow affect and less perception</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">westerly winds blow from the west and east coast across the Pacific Ocean and pick up moisture as they move across the ocean.</mark> As the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">winds encounter the mountain ranges on the west coast of North America, they are forced to rise and cool producing precipitation on the windward side of the mountains.</mark> As the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">air moves over the mountain and descends</mark> on the leeward side, it <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">warms and dries out, producing a rain shadow with less precipitation</mark>


# (13) Explain the cause of the alternating latitudinal bands of high and low precipitation as one moves from the tropics (wet) to 30° (dry) to temperate latitudes (wet again) to polar latitudes (dry)? 
 - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The air decreasing from the Hadley Cells at 30 degrees north/south is cool and dry.</mark> As that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">air goes towards the direction of the poles it begins to pick up moisture/warm air, so it rises.</mark> It will <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">meet the cool/descending air from the polar cells(at the poles)</mark> but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">because it is colder, the air coming from the direction of the Hadley cells at the equator</mark> will rise above that air. As that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">warm air rises, it causes precipitation at around 50-60 degrees N/S</mark>. Hence, the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">forests that appear at 60 degrees</mark>. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cooling air from this goes to 90 degrees so that's what causes cold deserts there.</mark>

# (14) Contrast autotrophs and heterotrophs in terms of how they acquire energy and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen).
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">autotrophs</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">obtain carbon through their stomata from the atmosphere and acquire energy from the sun using photosynthesis and nutrients from the ground like nitrogen and carbon. </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">heterotrophs</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">get carbon from autotrophs by consuming them and breaking them down by respiration. Must acquire these resources through the consumption of other organisms.</mark>


# (15) Describe two ways (two different things you could measure) to estimate the rate of carbon fixation by photosynthesis in a particular plant and be able to describe how you would use those measurements to estimate how much photosynthesis has occurred (Gross photosynthesis).
- The two ways to measure the rate of carbon fixation is by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">oxygen production</mark>. By measuring the rate of oxygen production we can estimate the rate of photosynthesis. Measure the rate of oxygen production in the plant. The amount of oxygen produced is proportional to the amount of carbon fixed by photosynthesis
- The second way is through <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">carbon dioxide uptake</mark> by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the plant. Usually done with measuring the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the plant and the rate of carbon dioxide uptake from the plant and the rate of carbon dioxide release from respiration. Subtract the rate of carbon dioxide release from the rate of carbon dioxide uptake
- These give an estimate of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NET photosynthesis</mark> =  <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">(Photosynthesis – Respiration)</mark>
- We would have two plants of the same species one being in the dark and seeing the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">change of O2</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">= respiration (negative)</mark>
- The other plant will be in the light and see the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">change of O2 in light</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">= Photosynthesis - Respiration</mark>
- The final equation will be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">(change O2 in light) - (change O2 in dark) = Gross(total) photosynthesis</mark>
- Example of estimating gross photosynthesis:
- ![[Pasted image 20230422150751.png]]

# (16) Using the following data, and an estimated Z-value of 0.25, estimate the number of species that will go extinct as a result of habitat destruction on each island. How does your estimate change if you use 0.15 or 0.35 as your Z-value?
![[Pasted image 20230422150821.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230422154147.png]]
- To solve the following use the equation above and plug in the values:
- $\frac{S_{remain}}{S_{inint}} = \frac{A_{remain}}{A_{inint}}$  
- $\frac{x}{38} = (0.67)^{0.25}$
- $\frac{x}{38}*38 = (0.67)^{0.25}*38$
- $x = (0.67)^{0.25}*38$
- $x = 34$
- Then to estimate how many species went extinct simply subtract the initial number of species by the remainder in this case is $x$ 
- $38 - 34 = 4$ , so we can estimate 4 species went extinct when there was 0.67 of the forest remaining
- We simply apply this to the rest of the data using the same rules and if we did it correctly these should be our answers:
- ![[Pasted image 20230422155549.png]]
- When we use 0.15 as our z value we must understand that the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">z value represents how quickly the number of species declines as the area decreases</mark> or the species area-curve. The<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> lower the z value indicates that fewer species are restricted to specific habitats within the area</mark> so when<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> those habitats are destroyed fewer species will be lost</mark>
- When we <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">use 0.35 as our z value that the species area curve is steeper and more species will go extinct as the area decreases.</mark> The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higher the z score means that more species are restricted to specific habitats within the area</mark> and since these species depend on them they will go extinct as the area decreases

# (17) Explain the concept of a trade-off and give an example of a tradeoff involving adaptations or strategies for (a) resource acquisition, (b) defense against herbivores or predators, and (c) dealing with environmental stress. (a separate tradeoff for each)
- The concept of a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">trade-off is that an organisms has to balance conflicting demands between two or more traits or characteristics.</mark> Involving the situation <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">where enhancing one trait or characteristics will have a cost to another trait or characteristics</mark>, resulting in a compromise or trade-off between the two
- An example of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">resource acquisition</mark>: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hummingbirds have long beaks for getting nectar out of flowers</mark> and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost might be that since it's a specialist species it can't use it's beak for other purposes</mark>(cracking shells to get food, unable to eat certain things)
- An example of trade-off of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">defense against herbivores or predators</mark> would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Investing resources in development of armored plates or spines (ex. armadillos or porcupines) reduces the animal’s agility and running speed</mark>
- An example of dealing with <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">environmental stress</mark>: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Plants in arid or cold environments, need to allocate resources to survive the environmental stress</mark>, such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">growing deeper roots, developing thicker cuticles</mark>, or accumulating solutes to maintain water balance. However, this comes at a<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> cost to reproduction, as plants have fewer resources available for producing flowers, fruits, and seeds.</mark>

# (18) On what three successive events does predation depend? Give one example of an adaptation of prey that reduce the likelihood of each of these events (each adaptation need not be from the same prey species)
- The three successive events that predation depend on are
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Detection:</mark> Predator must detect its prey through sight, smell, sound, or touch
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Capture:</mark> Once the predator finds its prey decide to pursue then it must successfully capture and subdue the prey. Involves the predators using hunting strategies 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Consumption:</mark> Once the predator captures its prey it now must consume to obtain the nutrients and energy to survive and reproduce
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example</mark> of adaptation of prey that reduce the likelihood of each of these events
	- To <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">avoid detection one can use camouflage</mark> like some species of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lizard have a body of a leaf that it can use to blend with its surrounding to avoid being found</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Costs is that it can only blend with certain environments and cant move as much = less resources</mark>
	- An <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adaptation to reduce being capture is travel in large groups like zebras</mark> or a school of fish which <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">makes it hard for predators to track individual prey</mark>
	- An adaptation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">avoiding being consumed</mark> can be from plants as they cannot move so they <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">spray chemical or use thorns as defense. Slow animals have chemical or mechanical defense</mark> 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sea slugs(toxins) and Pangolin(armor) </mark>

# (19) What is the greenhouse effect? Given the greenhouse effect, what are the likely consequences of humans burning “fossil fuels” in terms of global temperature?
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Greenhouse effect</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">natural process by which certain gasses in the Earth's atmosphere trap and re-emit infrared radiation</mark>, which <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">helps regulate the planet's temperature</mark>. Earth's atmosphere contains several gases that have this greenhouse effect like <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere which is a potent greenhouse gas</mark>. Concentration of CO2 and other <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase they trap more of sun's energy</mark> which leads to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">increase of the Earth's temperature that results in global warming.</mark>

# (20) Describe the evidence that humans are causing climate warming. What key evidence allows us to be very sure that the CO2 increase is from burning of fossil fuels and not from other causes?
- One of the main pieces of evidence is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">correlation of carbon emissions/fossil fuel burnings and the atmospheric CO2 during the era of the Industrial Revolution</mark> as the there was a rapid rise in CO2 during this era.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Atmospheric changes that are consistent with the human-caused warming</mark>, including increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased by more than 40% since the start of the Industrial Revolution</mark>, primarily <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.</mark>
- Earth's surface has warmed by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2.0 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s, with much of this warming occurring in the past few decades.
- The key evidence that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">allows us to be sure that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is from burning fossil fuels</mark> as carbon has two stable isotopes: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">carbon-12 and carbon-13</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Fossil fuels are derived from ancient plant and animal material</mark> that have been buried for million of years that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">contains a lower ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 compared to the current atmosphere.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Burning fossil fuels</mark> has caused a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">decline in the atmospheric carbon-13/carbon-12 ratio.</mark> This <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">decline in the ratio provides strong evidence that the increase in atmospheric CO2 largely due to the burning of fossil fuels</mark>

# (21) Terrestrial plants will not make all the CO2 from burning of fossil fuels go away because _________________________. (explain why). Can this limitation be easily solved? Why or why not?
- This is because <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">plants are going to be nitrogen limited</mark> instead of carbon limited and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">then there will be no change of the plants when they were given CO2</mark> and that results in them <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not being able to take in all the CO2 that is in the air from burning fossil fuels</mark>
- This limitation cannot be easily solved as we could just add nitrogen to counter act this limitation as it isn't particle. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It is really energy expensive and that energy is made from burning fossil fuels</mark>
- We are able to solve the limitation problem by adding fertilizer but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NET Effect will not be to take very much CO2 out of the atmosphere</mark> as we'll <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">probably be putting as much CO2 into the atmosphere by fixing all this fertilizer</mark>
- NET effect would not be positive
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Unless we cutback the use of fossil fuels and stop destroying our environment faster than its finite rate of growth we will not be able to solve this problem.</mark>

# (22) Many desert plants have stomata that are sunken well below the under-surface of the leaf. While we did not discuss these directly in class, based on concepts covered in lecture, you should be able to explain why such “stomatal crypts” would reduce water loss via transpiration? How would you expect such structures to affect the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the leaf, and why?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Water lost is due to diffusion and diffusion rate increases</mark> when the difference between the outside and inside concentration is greater. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If the Stomata is hidden away</mark>, the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">outside water concentration be higher and closer to the inside water concentration therefore leading to less water loss</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">sunken stomata are likely to reduce the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the leaf.</mark> This is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">because these structures increase the diffusion pathway for carbon dioxide to enter the leaf which makes it more difficult for carbon dioxide to reach the sites of photosynthesis</mark> within the leaf. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">increased diffusion pathway leads to decrease in the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide into the leaf and slows down the process of photosynthesis</mark>

# (23) Humans have a seemingly insatiable appetite for fats, sugars and salt. From an evolutionary standpoint, why are these food preferences not surprising? What are the consequences of these preferences for humans in today’s ecological conditions?
- This is not surprising because they <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">give us the most energy and calories as our evolutionary ancestors evolved to prefer foods that are high in energy content</mark>, like fats and sugars. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Providing fuel to survive and reproduce</mark>. 
- The<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> consequences the global increase of obesity, diabetes, and other disease</mark>
- Another one is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">impact it has on the environment as the are highly processed and often require significant amounts of energy and resources to produce</mark>. Leads to increase greenhouse emissions and soil degradation
- The last one is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">development of large-scale industrial agriculture</mark> which can have negative effects of biodiversity and ecosystem health. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers can also harm non-target species and contribute to soil and water pollution</mark>

# For the next two questions use the graph below describing a shorebird foraging on snails in tidepools on the California coast. Through observations and laboratory experiments you find the following relationships between snail size, energy content, and handling time: 
![[Pasted image 20230423135012.png]]

# (24) Based on these data which size class of prey would you predict would be preferred by the shorebirds if the bird forages to maximize energy intake per unit time?
- Based on the data I would predict that they class of prey that shorebirds would preferred are 3cm prey as they take handling time to energy content ratio is the highest compared to the rest

# (25) If birds preferred snails in size class #1, what explanation might you offer for what other ecological factor determines prey choice?
- The explanation for choosing snails is that they take the least amount of time compared to the rest of the preys 
- Another reason could be the beak size of the bird as it can only allow them to only capture and consume the snails

# (26) In addition to energy maximization, what other objectives might foragers (consumers) have in selecting prey? Explain how these objectives might conflict with the objective of maximizing energy intake per unit time
- Other objectives that predators may take into consideration <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">is the risk factor to hunt and capture certain prey</mark> the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">risk/reward ratio</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">time/reward ratio</mark>
- Also<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> the abundance of prey</mark> can influence what species they hunt
- Example: Prey may provide large amount of energy but could be difficult to capture increasing the risk of injury or death so predators in this case will chose smaller prey instead 



# (27) Be able to define and use the following terms:
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Adaptation</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Evolutionary change in genotype that maximizes performance</mark>
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example</mark>: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Native Americans have barrel-shaped bodies with shorter arms and legs relative to their height to reduce heat loss</mark>
- Population of birds lives in an environment where seeds with hard shells are the main food source, birds with stronger beaks that can break that can crack the seeds and more likely to survive and procreate. Over time the population will evolve to have stronger beaks as a result of adaptation

## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Acclimation:</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Change in the phenotype within an individuals lifetime to maximizes performance usually reversible</mark>(phenotype: characteristics of appearance like hair color)
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example:</mark> 1)<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Humans native to temperate latitudes tan in the summer months when exposure to the sun is greatest</mark>. 2) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Moving a plant from a cool environment to a warmer one, it may acclimate by producing more heat shock proteins to protect its cells from heat stress.</mark>

- Acclimation happens in response to different environmental changes like:
	- changes in temperature
	- light levels
	- humidity
	- pH
	- salinity
- Acclimation is a temporary response to a specific environmental change, and that it does not involve genetic changes or heritable traits. Although if the environmental change persists for long enough, the organisms may eventually undergo genetic adaptation to better suit its new environment  

## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Endotherms</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Body temperature is determined primarily by metabolic energy(generates their own heat). Commonly known as "warm-blooded" because they are able to maintain to relatively constant body temperature even in cold environments</mark>
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples:</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bears, hummingbirds, polar bears able to maintain constant body temperature in cold temps allowing it to hunt and survive</mark>
- Endotherms have <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">high metabolic rate, generates heat as a byproduct of energy production. </mark>
- Have specialized insulation, such as fur or feathers


## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Ectotherms</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Body temperature is determined primarily by external conditions(rely on other sources of heat or own behaviors). Refers as "cold blooded" as they cannot regulate their body temperature internally.</mark>
### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples:</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sharks, reptiles, fishes</mark>
- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reptile may bask in the sun to warm its body, or move to a cooler area to cool down.</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Dependence on external temperatures means that ectothermic organisms are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations</mark> and could become sluggish or even dormant in extreme temps
- Have lower metabolic rate and not able to maintain constant body temperature in the same way that endothermic organisms can
- Many ectotherms can absorb heat as they have scales and skin that allows to do this
- They have behavioral adaptions as they cab burrow underground or seek shade to avoid these extreme temperatures

## $C_3$ vs. $C_4$ photosynthesis
###  $C_3$ : <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">more common type of photosynthesis that occurs in a wide variety of plant species.</mark> During C3 photosynthesis, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">CO2 is fixed into organic compounds in the plant's chloroplasts using enzyme Rubisco.</mark> Rubisco <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">tends to bind with oxygen that leads to photorespiration that reduces the efficiency of C3 photosynthesis.</mark> Have a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lower water-use efficiency</mark>

### $C_4$ : more <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">specialized type of photosynthesis that is found in certain plants that grow in hot, arid environments.</mark> C4 plants have a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">unique anatomical and biochemical adaptation that allows them to increase the concentration of CO2 around Rubisco.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">More efficient because the stoma isn't open for that long so not as much water is lost and takes more energy</mark> Reducing photorespiration and increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. CO2 is initially fixed into a four-carbon compound in specialized cells called mesophyll cells. Then transported to bundle sheath cells where it is released and used in the traditional C3 pathway. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Have a higher water-use efficiency</mark>

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Difference between the two:</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 plants are more widespread and dominate in temperature regions but the stoma stays open so it loses way too much water</mark>, while <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants are well adapted to hot dry conditions</mark> and are often found in grasslands and savannas. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 plants are more commonly found in forests and other mesic environments</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants are generally more efficient at photosynthesis and can fix more carbon per unit of water used</mark>

## Think about how the Stomata opens to bring in co2, 
- For C3 plants, colder environments it doesn't have to worry as much about losing water as there is always an abundance of water
- C4 plants are from drier climates and waters more scarce so it's adapted to not keep stomata open as long using this enzyme PEP carboxylase to bring in Co2

# (28) How would you expect increasing CO2 and temperature affect the performance of C3 and C4 plants?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 plants are generally more efficient at photosynthesis at lower temperatures and lower light levels</mark>
- At <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higher temperatures and higher CO2 levels their photosynthetic rates become limited by the enzymes available </mark>
- Some plants will either increase in growth and others will decrease
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants are more efficient at photosynthesis at higher temperatures in a high light environment</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Increasing the CO2 concentration could benefit CO4 plants that will increase their growth and yield</mark>
## What do you think the consequences of humans burning fossil fuels might be for the relative success of these plant types?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Increasing CO2 concentrations would benefit C3 plants by increasing their rate of photosynthesis</mark> while <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants may not see the same or have an decrease in photosynthetic rate </mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">increased temperatures that come with burning fossil fuels can negatively affect both C3 and C4 plants</mark> 
## How does your answer change based on whether you consider (i) only the DIRECT effects of CO2 increase itself
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 plants are expected to have a greater relative success</mark> compared to C4 plants <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">due to their higher responsiveness to increased CO2 concertation </mark>
## (ii) direct effects plus including the increased temperature due to CO2 increase
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants may have a relative advantage over C3 plants due to their better tolerance of higher temperatures </mark>
## (iii) everything in (ii) plus the possible effect of increased temperatures on plant water stress?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">T</mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">his may further benefit C4 plants as they are better adapted to arid conditions and have more efficient water use strategies </mark>

# (28) Compare the effect of temperature on photosynthesis of the C3 vs the C4 plant in the figure below (at right). Over which temperature range does the C3 plant have higher rates of net photosynthetic update than the C4 plant? At which temperatures does photosynthetic uptake by the C4 plant exceed that of the C3 plant? Explain the reasons for the changing relative success of C3 and C4 plants as temperature increases. What could you do (what manipulation could you make) to reduce the advantage that the “winner” has over the “loser” at high temperature?
![[Pasted image 20230423124804.png|600]]
- The C3 plant have a higher photosynthetic update than the C4 plant at the lower temperatures especially from 15$^o$C - 48$^o$ C degrees.
- The C4 plant have a higher photosynthetic uptake by the C4 plant exceed the C3 plant at higher temperature especially within the range of 35$^o$ C-50$^o$ C 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The reasons the success of these plants differ as temperature changes is due to the plants tolerance of certain conditions</mark>
## Explain the reasons for the changing relative success of C3 and C4 plants as temperature increases.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 plants are generally more efficient at photosynthesis at lower temperatures and lower light levels.</mark> the rate of photorespiration in C3 plants also increases when the temperature does so their photosynthetic rate decreases
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C3 benefits from an increase of CO2 </mark>but C4 doesn't really benefit all that much whereas <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higher temperatures C4 plants will benefit more but C3 will not</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If both Co2 and temperature rises then its harder to predict if either one will benefit from it or not</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">C4 plants are more efficient at photosynthesis at higher temperatures in a high light environment</mark>. They adapted to reduces the rate of photorespiration and allows them to photosynthesize more efficiently
## What could you do (what manipulation could you make) to reduce the advantage that the “winner” has over the “loser” at high temperature?
-<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> Make conditions that mimic cooler environments </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Shading the plants to reduce the amount of direct sunlight they receive</mark> or use sprinklers or other methods to cool them and surrounding environment


# Some people reason that rising carbon dioxide will benefit humanity because plants use carbon dioxide, so adding it to the atmosphere will increase plant productivity, increasing food supplies. Tests of this hypothesis in which CO2 is doubled over large areas of forest or fields often find data that look like this:

# (29) What can you conclude from these results about the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on the rate of biomass production by trees? 
- The conclusion based from the results is that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">there was an initial positive reaction of having plants take up the CO2 </mark>that was in the air as the biomass of trees increased when they took this CO2 from the air
- But <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">later on the years the increase of trees biomass began to decrease and wasn't as positive in the beginning as there became a limiting factor to the plants</mark> as the<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> plants were being given too much CO2 and thus need for something else to help them grow</mark>
## Offer one explanation for why the results from these and other “open air” experiments typically find smaller effects of CO2 on plant growth than experiments conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions?
- An <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">explanation that the results</mark> for these "open air" experiments typically find smaller effects of CO2 i<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">s that there are other limiting factors and environmental stresses that can offset the benefits of increased CO2</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Nutrient availability, water availability, temperature and pest pressures can all affect plant growth</mark>
- Whereas <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">greenhouse conditions can have these limitations minimized or eliminated allowing the effects of CO2 to be more easily isolated and observed</mark>
## How would you test whether your explanation was correct?
- We can measure the plant's growth under both open air and controlled greenhouse conditions
