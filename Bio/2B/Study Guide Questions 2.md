## What are the characteristics of species with “r” and “K” selected life histories?
## The characteristics of the "r" species
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">many small offspring</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">s</mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">mall body size</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">short life, reproduce at young age</mark>
- allocate<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> rapid growth</mark> and high reproduction
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">little parental care</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Semelparity</mark>
	- the births happen at same time happen all at once
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">they produce once and die</mark>
	- put all resources into reproduction and die
## The characteristics of the "k" species
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">fewer, invest more into each offspring</mark>
	- individual offspring more resources into offspring after birth
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">larger body size</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">long life expectancy</mark>, delayed reproduction
- allocate resource for and prioritize defense, persistence 
- lots of parental care and investment
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Iteroparity</mark>:
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reproducing throughout life, many times reproduction</mark>

## What are the characteristics of environments that are likely to favor each type?

### The environments that favor the r-selected
- keep populations at low density
- Habitat
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">unpredictable</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">harsh, disturbed, wipe the slate clean</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">resources generally available</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Mortality is independent of other organisms and often catastrophic</mark>
- Example:
	- Fields that are frequently mowed
	- places where fires happen a lot
	- floods annually would contain more r-selected species 
- rapid growth is possible

### The environments that favor the k-selected
- environmental conditions allow populations to reach high density 
- Habitat is
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">predictable </mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">low resource availability</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">favorable for growth and survival</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Mortality is often caused by interactions with other organisms</mark>(not independent)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">limited resources and competition</mark>
- density dependent interactions with others are the dominant forces 

## Why do you think these two groups were given the names “r” and “K”?
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">r stands for rapid</mark> as species under the group of *r* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reproduce at a fast rate</mark> and the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rise at an exponential growth</mark>(r)
- The K represents the logistic growth(K) and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">part of an environment when the population nears K(carrying capacity)</mark> as it has <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lower intrinsic rates</mark> of population growth and have higher survival rates and longer lifespans

## Understand and be able to explain, define, and use the following terms
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">population</mark>
- A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">collection or amount of organisms of the same species that are living in the same area at the same time</mark>
- This can a be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">groups of plants, animals, that share a common gene pool</mark> and can interbreed to produce viable offspring
- Population can help us <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">understand how they grow and decline over time and their interaction with other species within their environment. </mark>How they respond to changes to environment like climate changes or new species 
- Factors that influence population dynamics include birth and death rates, immigration & emigration rates, competition for resources, predation, and disease
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">exponential growth</mark>
- The pre-capita <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">growth rate is constant or density independent</mark>
- Grows proportional to the size of the population and is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">usually represented on a graph with a j shaped curve </mark>
-  ![[Pasted image 20230418175927.png]]
- as the<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> population size increases rapidly at first and then to increase at an accelerating rate</mark>
- Exponential Growth <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">happens when a species is introduced in an environment with little competition, abundant resources, or other limiting factors </mark>
- Exponential <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cannot happen indefinitely as the population reaches it carrying capacity at some point</mark>
- Helps us understand how populations change over time and how they respond to different environmental conditions.
- Help predict how populations respond to habitat loss or human impacts on the environment
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">logistic growth</mark>
- The per-capita growth rate <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">varies with population density or is density dependent </mark>
- Happens when a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">population growth occurs when a population grows exponentially in the beginning, but eventually stabilizes at the carrying capacity  </mark>
- ![[Pasted image 20230421204339.png]]
- The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">carrying capacity</mark> is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">maximum amount of individuals of a particular species.</mark>
- A population refers to a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular geographic area at the same time, and capable of interbreeding with each other
- Important to understand how populations of organisms interact with their environment and how changes in environmental conditions can affect their size and distribution of population over time
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">density dependence vs. density independence</mark> 
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">morality and death rates of a species is determined from the population of the species</mark> when it is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">density dependent</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples: overcrowding, scarce resources, cannibalism</mark>  
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">morality of a species is not being affected from the population of the species</mark> when it is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">density independent</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples: natural events like frost or hurricane</mark>
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">carrying capacity</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">maximum number of individuals that can be supported by the available resource in the environment </mark>
- The carrying capacity is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">determined by the availability of resources, such as food, water, and space, as well as by the ability of the ecosystem to absorb and recycle waste products</mark>
- As a population <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">approaches its carrying capacity, competition for resources increases</mark> and that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">leads to decrease of population/growth rate</mark>
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">demography</mark>
- A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">study of the vital statistics (birth, death) of a population and how they vary with age</mark>
- Use to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">understand and predict population growth, decline, and stability</mark>
- Helps us <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">understand the factors that affect population size and structure</mark>
- The information found through the demography of a species can model the population growth over time, and to identify the factors that are most likely to model population growth over time, and to identify factors that are most likely to influence population size and structure
- Make predictions about the population's future growth and decline and develop management strategies to conserve to control the population as needed
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">life table</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Vital statistics of cohort</mark>(group of individuals born about the same time)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">an age-specific summary of the survival pattern of a population</mark>
- ![[Pasted image 20230421201749.png]]
- Life tables are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">made from studying cohort or group of individuals born during the same time period</mark>, and tracking their survival and reproductive success over the course of their lifetimes
- They are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">useful for studying populations as they allow researchers to make predictions about future population growth</mark>, identify key life history traits that contribute to population growth or decline, and evaluate the effects of environmental changes on population dynamics
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">age specific survivorship</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">probability of individuals surviving to a certain age in a population</mark>
- Is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">component of a life table that shows the probability of an individual surviving to a specific age</mark>, given their age at the beginning of the observation period  
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example:</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sea turtles have the age-specific survivorship curve that shows the probability of each individual surviving from hatching to the age of one year, two years, three years, and so on</mark>
- Curve shows that many turtles die after hatching but those who do survive have a higher probability of reaching adulthood
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">age specific fecundity</mark>
- Is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a measure (Mx) of the reproductive output of individuals in a population at different ages.</mark> Referring to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">number of offspring produced by individuals of a particular age class.</mark> 
- Important as it helps predict how population size will change over time based on the reproductive potential of individuals of different ages
## <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">net reproductive rate(R0)</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Average number of offspring produced an individual during its entire lifetime</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Calculated by summing the age specific fecundity</mark>(the number of female offspring produced per female) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">across all age classes</mark> and adjusting for survivorship between age classes
- ![[Pasted image 20230421231950.png]]
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Multiply proportion surviving(lx) and age-specific fecundity(mx) </mark>and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">then add the products to get the net productive rate</mark>
- It <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">provides information about the reproductive success of a population and its potential for growth</mark>
- It's used in life tables analysis and population projections and it can be affected by various factors such as age-specific mortality rates

# (3)
## Explain the difference between r and $R_o$. Under which values of each is population growth positive, negative, and zero?
- $R_0$ is the<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> average number of offspring produced an individual during its entire lifetime.</mark> And to get the $R_0$ of a certain species, it's the products of survival and fecundity summed over all age classes 
- Whereas <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">r is an instantaneous birth and death rate</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Looking for the difference of the rate of birth and rate of death. r = b - d</mark>
	- For $R_0$, if the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">number is greater than 1 then the population is increasing</mark> at a positive rate
	- $R_0$ = 0, then it means that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">there is no change to the population so it will be zero</mark>
	- $R_0$ < 1, then it means that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">there is a decrease in the population growth</mark>

# (4)
## Explain how a finite availability of resources can produce density dependent population growth. What other factors can cause density dependence?
- A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">finite availability of resources can produce density dependent population growth as the population of a particular species start to increase in population then there will be more individuals that need this finite available resource</mark> and since it <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">is finite the resource wont last forever</mark>. So that will mean as the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">population increase then the resource will decrease</mark> as well which will <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cause an increase of individuals to fight among themselves</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Other factors</mark> that can cause density dependence is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overpopulation which could lead predation</mark> as a p<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">redator could start to hunt a certain species because they notice that there are more of them</mark> which equals to more food for the predator
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Overcrowding can cause density dependent as it creates more competition between others</mark> and those <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">interactions between on another can cause more deaths</mark> as competition can cause fighting with each other

# (5)
## Identify the four fundamental processes that dictate whether a population is growing or declining, and define an open versus closed population in terms of these processes.
The four fundamental processes are:
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">birthrate(b)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">death rate(d)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">immigration(i)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">emigration rate(e)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Open population:</mark> the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">numbers change due to immigration and emigration from outside the population</mark> in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">addition to birth and rates</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Closed population:</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">numbers change within a population only due to birth and death rates within</mark>


# (6)
## Which of the following limit logistic population growth?
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">survival decreases with increasing population density</mark>
	- As <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">population density increases resources start to become more limited and which causes the rate of survival to decrease</mark> which leads to the vulnerability of disease and predation
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reproductive rates decrease with increasing population density</mark>
	- This is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">density dependent factor that can limit logistic population growth</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Population density increases individuals may have reduced access to resources </mark>

# (7)
## Each graph depicts population growth over time for different populations, shown by dotted, dashed or solid curves. Answer the following questions about the following two graphs
![[Pasted image 20230418181910.png]]
1) which of the two graphs describes exponential growth (left or right)?
	1) The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">left graph describes exponential growth as it starts at low levels and then continues to increases at a constant rate for a period of time</mark>
	2) The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">right side is logistical growth as we see the rate of the population become more stable when it reaches a certain point which we can assume is the carrying capacity</mark>
2) On the left graph, which population has greatest r?
	1) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The dashed line has the greatest r as it seems to be increasing at a faster rate than the other lines </mark>
3) On the right graph which population has a higher carrying capacity?
	1) The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">dashed line has the higher carrying capacity as the line starts to increase at a rate closer to zero at a higher population size</mark> compared to the solid line
4) On the right graph, which population has a higher r?
	1) <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The solid line has the higher r as it increases faster than the dashed line despite having a smaller carrying capacity</mark>

# (8) 
## Given the following patterns of birth (solid line) and death (dashed line) rates in a population over time, sketch a graph of population size over time.
![[Pasted image 20230423173440.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230423222533.png|500]]

![[Pasted image 20230423173425.png|200]]
- The reasoning for this picture is because looking at the first graph we notice that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the birth and death rate or close to each other</mark> but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">then we notice that the birth rate(solid line) has a large gap between the death rate(dotted line)</mark> so then the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">population growth starts to increase at a fast rate</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Then both of birth and death rates start to be equal in terms of their rate</mark> and so our graph will start to even out

## The fictitious data below represent a cohort life table for the wild turkeys that live in Davis. Use the data to answer the following questions
![[Pasted image 20230418183804.png]]
## How is the population of turkeys changing in size over time?
- The population is growing at a logistical way as it there is little growth in the beginning but then start to grow at a constant rate until it reaches a point where the growth stops due to high mortality 
## What type of survivorship curve would you say this species has?
- It has a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">type 1 survivorship curves</mark> as the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">survival for infants are guaranteed to survive but as they grow older their mortality rates increases</mark>
## If you were hired as the wildlife biologist for the city and wanted to stabilize the population size (prevent extinction and prevent the population from increasing) what specific approach might you take with this population? Consider what specific age classes are most critical to focus your efforts on and what action you might take (alter survival vs. fecundity)
- We can <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">prevent the population from increasing and also prevent extinction by decreasing the survivorship of the the Adult class</mark> as they <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">are producing the most offsprings compared to the other Age classes</mark>
- Another method that we can do is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">give birth control to the Adult Class as they produce the most offsprings</mark>

## Which of the following is the best example of density-independent population regulation of a population of insects? Are any examples of density-dependent population regulation?

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Density-independent</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cold temperatures kill 80 percent of the insects in a particular area</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A contagious disease sweeps through a dense population</mark>
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Density-dependent</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Predators search widely for places where insects are abundant and concentrate their hunting in those areas</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A rapid increase in a population of insects leads to a depletion of the food supply. As a result, the insects are starving and produce few offspring.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">When insects are abundant, other predators switch from their preferred prey to a primary diet of insects</mark>
